.SH NAME
.B ./hsh
- a simple UNIX command line interpreter as part of the first trimester project.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
.I $[COMMAND FILE [ARGUMENT...]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Makes use of the command prompt for the user to type a command. Each command is  executed and ends with a new line, and the prompt is displayed each time any command has been executed. The command lines are simple, no semi-columns, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
.Pp
If an executable cannot be found, prints an error message and displays the prompt again. Handles errors, the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D), command lines with arguments and the PATH. Makes use of the exit built-in, that exits the shell (Usage: exit). Also implements the env built-in, that prints the current environment.
.SH OPTIONS
.B
A  simple command is a sequence of optional variable assignments followed by blank-separated words and redirections, and terminated by a control operator.  The first word specifies the command to be executed, and is passed as argument zero.  The remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked command.
.PP
The return value of a simple command is its exit status, or 128+n if the command is terminated by signal n.
.SS
Piplines
A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of the control operators | or |&.  The format for a pipeline is:
.PP
[command [..ARGS]] [| - |&] [command2 [..ARGS]]
.PP
The standard output is connected via a pipe to the standard input of command2.  This connection is performed before any redirections specified by the command (see REDIRECTION below).   If |&  is  used,  command produces a standard error, in addition to its standard output, is connected to command2's standard input through the pipe; it is shorthand for 2>&1 |.  This implicit redirection of the standard error to the standard output is performed after any redirections specified by the command.
.SS Lists
A list is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the operators ;, &, &&, or ||, and optionally terminated by one of ;, &, or <newline>.
Of these list operators, && and || have equal precedence, followed by ; and &, which have equal precedence.
A sequence of one or more newlines may appear in a list instead of a semicolon to delimit commands.
.PP
If  a command is terminated by the control operator &, the shell executes the command in the background in a subshell.  The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0.
Commands separated by a ; are executed sequentially; the shell waits for each command to terminate in turn.  The return status is the exit status of the last command executed.
AND and OR lists are sequences of one or more pipelines separated by the && and || control operators, respectively.  AND and OR lists are executed with left associativity.  An AND list has the form
.PP
command1 && command2
.PP
command2 is executed if, and only if, command1 returns an exit status of zero.
.PP
An OR list has the form:
.PP
command1 || command2
.PP
command2 is executed if and only if command1 returns a non-zero exit status.  The return status of AND and OR lists is the exit status of the last command executed in the list.
